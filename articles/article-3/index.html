    <p>
      Classical dance forms in India are structured and follow certain rules. These rules have been mentioned in ancient treatises. One such prominent example is Bharata's Natyashastra. Here the position of hands and limbs is specified, and depending on the form, the movement, costume design, colours used, and structure of a performance is often talked about in detail. In contrast to the folk dance forms, a classical dance form strictly adheres to these rules. For example, the hand gestures and body postures have to be precise. This makes learning a classical dance form challenging, but at the same time reaps benefits like building muscle strength, toning, facial expressions, better communication, discipline and literary and historical knowledge.

    <h2>Ancient Origins and Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      The origins of classical dance forms can be debated, resulting in diverse theories about its evolution. What is certain, however, is that these dance forms are very old. Architectural figurines and sculptures are evidences. Next time you visit temple spaces, look around if you see a dancer, a musician, or an instrument engraved on its walls or pillars!

    <h2>The Art of Communication Through Dance</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most fascinating aspects of classical dance is that, it uses hand gestures (mudra or hastha) and facial expressions (abhinaya) as a medium of communication. You can build stories and narratives, and creatively communicate your ideas to a larger audience. The intricate pattern of movements are not just visually beautiful but are a great medium to build better hand eye coordination, improve focus and concentration. And most importantly, classical dance forms give us a better sense of Bhava, Raga and Tala!
