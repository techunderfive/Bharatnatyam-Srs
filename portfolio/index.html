    <p>
      Training in the performance arts not only taught me to dance, but it helped me understand, music, beats and rhythm. It led me to learn the nattuvangam (cymbals) which is essential for teaching the dance form. It made me realise that dance is close to science and mathematics, be it through its impact on health or the geometric poses or calculation of the beats. For me Bharatanatyam is yoga in motion. It takes care of my mind and body. My rendezvous with art has helped me with improving my health, focus, discipline, personality and communication. I have also gained better insights into Indian culture and aesthetics, which has enhanced my creativity and self expression through story telling and narration.

      I try to extend this experience forward to my students by teaching them a comprehensive course of Bharatanatyam in the Kalakshetra technique.
